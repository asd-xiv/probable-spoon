# Probable Spoon Monorepo

- An application monorepo is the concatenation of it's component's repositories. It does not have code of it's own. It is an optional organizing tool.
- Using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to run scripts across multiple repos and automatic package linking for fast local development.
- Using [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to allow each component it's own code, scripts, issues, history etc.
